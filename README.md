In k8s community, we have simple deployment k8s cluster avilable such as minikube, k3s, microk8s.

I think it is good to have microStratos, which do all-in-one with one node. In that cluster, staros is preinstalled so that people can taste the straos before they purchase. IMO, this is a good idea for marketing purpose.

Target.
1. Easy to install so that non-techical people can taste it
2. Show visiblely so that they can deploy in stratos web UI.

Best usage would be:
1. deploy microStratos
2. Login to stratos web UI.
3. Customer can deploy apps in Stratos
4. Through terminal in stratos, custumers can use kubectl comment.
